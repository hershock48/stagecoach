/**
 * Reserve and contact enquiries.
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * STATUS: NOT LIVE. No enquiry sent through this site reaches an inbox yet.
 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * Deliberately fails loudly. With no RESEND_API_KEY or INQUIRY_FROM set this
 * returns 503 reason "not_configured" and InquiryForm hands off to the
 * visitor's email app with the fields prefilled. There is no path below that
 * returns ok:true without a provider having accepted the message, because a
 * form that reports success without delivering is worse than no form. The
 * version this replaced waited 500ms, said "Thanks, we got it" and sent
 * nothing anywhere.
 *
 * TO SWITCH IT ON, four steps:
 *
 *   1. Get the bar's real monitored inbox. SITE.email is currently
 *      the address in SITE.email, which is a PLACEHOLDER: their current site
 *      publishes no email anywhere, only a form.
 *
 *   2. Verify a sending domain in Resend. Resend requires DNS records on
 *      whatever domain the From address lives on, and we do not control
 *      stagecoach1838.com DNS, the client does. Do not wait on them: verify
 *      glazedweb.com and send from e.g. stagecoach@glazedweb.com. The reply_to
 *      below is set to the customer's own address, so the bar hits reply and
 *      it goes straight to the customer. Same verified domain works for every
 *      site we build.
 *
 *   3. Set RESEND_API_KEY, INQUIRY_FROM and INQUIRY_TO in the Vercel project.
 *      See .env.example.
 *
 *   4. Redeploy, then actually submit the form once and confirm it arrives.
 *      The success panel only appears when Resend accepted the message, so if
 *      you see it, delivery was accepted.
 *
 * Known gap while this is unconfigured: the mailto fallback needs the visitor
 * to have a registered mail handler. Desktop webmail users get nothing from
 * that click beyond the on-screen note and the phone number.
