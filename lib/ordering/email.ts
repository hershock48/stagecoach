// Guest email: order confirmation and refund notice.
//
// Sends through Resend's REST API with the same delivery posture as the
// enquiry form (see glaze.md): when RESEND_API_KEY is unset, the email is
// NOT faked -- the full payload goes to the server log so nothing is lost,
// and the caller carries on. Email here is a courtesy copy of state the
// guest can already see on their confirmation screen, so best-effort is the
// honest level: an email failure must never fail an order.
//
// From-address strategy is the studio standard: a verified glazedweb.com
// sender, reply_to the bar's inbox, so no client DNS work is ever on the
// critical path.
